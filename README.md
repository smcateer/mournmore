# Mournmore

## About

This project generates **Mournmore Code**, an unofficial Modified Version derived from GitHub’s Monaspace fonts.

The font takes the Argon font family from Monaspace and uses it for the regular font styles and Radon for the italic styles. The name is from the fictional molecule monoradon monoargonide -> moarmorn -> mournmore. I reckon it has a fontish kind of sound to it.

It style-links:

| Mournmore Code style | Source |
|---|---|
| Regular | Monaspace Argon Frozen Regular |
| Italic | Monaspace Radon Frozen Regular |
| Bold | Monaspace Argon Frozen Bold |
| Bold Italic | Monaspace Radon Frozen Bold |

## Usage

The practical purpose is to let editors such as VS Code use Radon for comments by mapping comments to italic.

```json
{
  "editor.fontFamily": "'Mournmore Code', monospace",
  "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "textMateRules": [
      {
        "scope": ["comment", "punctuation.definition.comment"],
        "settings": {
          "fontStyle": "italic"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
